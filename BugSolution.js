The solution uses functional updates with `setState`.  The functional update receives the previous state as an argument, ensuring that the update correctly reflects the changes.  This avoids the race condition by making the updates atomic:

```javascript
handleClick = () => {
  this.setState(prevState => ({
    count: prevState.count + 1
  }));
};
```
